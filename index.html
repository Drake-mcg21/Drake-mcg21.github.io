        <h2>Projects</h2>
        
        <h3>Capstone Project: Indoor Movements and How Well We Mimic there Movemenents</h3>
        <li> A project that compares the sport of ice hockey to rollerblading using EMG sensors and Load cell sensors. Tracked and stored the users muscle activity and weight distribution during test drills. This data was then run through a data analysis process using MATLAB, where we able to conclude that ice skating and roller blading have a 90% similarity in movements. For more details and report infomation that can be found  <a href="https://github.com/CarletonProjectTeam35">here.</a></li>
        <h3>Alpha Security</h3>
        <li>Using Raspberry Pis to create a home security system with a tripwire, camera, noise detection, and motion sensor. This can be seen <a href="https://github.com/bradenhayes/Alpha_Security">here!</a></li>
        <h3>UX Design Project</h3>
        <li>Tasked with pitching a new software project. Had to identify personas, along with their importance and impact. The creation of scenarios in which the user would access the system. Creating Lo-Fi prototypes using Balsamiq. This project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/Drake-mcg21/Balsamiq"> here!</a></li>
        <h3>Snow Plow Robot</h3>
        <li>Using coppeliasim to create and design to plow snow the greatest amount of snow and detect and avoid obstacles in 5 minutes. Robot was coded in lua and had to run through 3 different test maps. </li>
        <h3>Simple Cache System</h3>
        <li>Creating a simple 32 bit cache system <a href="https://github.com/Drake-mcg21/Cache">here!</a></li>
        <h3>Collison Detection Headphones</h3>
        <li>Researched patents to create a collision detection and warning system for distracted pedestrians used in conjunction with existing headphones. Acted as team leader, organised meetings to research patents to be used to develop the design and technology of the headphones.</li>
