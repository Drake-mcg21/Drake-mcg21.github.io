<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>For our capstone project we chose the task of doing Indoor Training and How Well We Mimick the Movements, for this we chose to do hockey and how well roller blading mimicks ice hockey. For this project I have been 
    tasked with working on hardware and the software side. For the hardware side we are using 6 EMGS to capture the movements of the muscles of the skater. We are also using load cell sensors to capture the amount of 
    pressure the skater is exxerting on the surface. It was my job then to bridge these measurements over to the software side and then utilize the data in a way it easy to interpret. We then created a GUI to then house
    this data to be displayed effectively. This project can be seen <a href="https://github.com/MarioShebib/HockeyDataThingyAnalysis" target="_blank" >  here!</a> 

<p> During my third year we were tasked with doing a project with 4 people and 4 Raspberry Pi's. For this project we decided to make an at home security system. This involved many diffrent steps and many diffrent 
    techniques which we were very unfimilair with, such as SQL databases, API services, and AWS webstreaming. We created a GUI using python that allowed all the RPi's to speak to eachother and it even sent text alerts to the user.
